# Task 1 ==> Grocery Store Math

banana = 2.0
cherries = 1.50
beef = 200.00

# I am doing my best but math is not my forte. lol




# Task 2 ==> Bank Interest

amount = 200000 # Initial Investment
int = 8.9 # annual interest rate
years = 20 # number of years
future_value = amount * ((1 + (0.01 * int)) ** years) # interest formula
print(round(future_value, 2)) # rounding the future value to 2 decimal places
