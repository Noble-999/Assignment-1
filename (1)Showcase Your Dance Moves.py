# Task 1 ==> Code Correction
weather = "sunny"

if weather == "sunny":
    print("Wear sunglasses!")
else:
    print("Take an umbrella!")
#(question) The code runs as expected without indention of the else statment and with indentation. Does indenting the statemnt just provide clarity, or does it matter with this short amount of code?





# Task 2 ==> Your Mood Today

users_mood = input("How are you feeling today?:")
print("Mood today is: " + users_mood)
if users_mood == "happy":
    print("That's great to hear!")
if users_mood == "sad":
    print("I hope your day gets better!")

# I know this can be cleaned up more but I am unsure of how to do that. Pointers would be greatly appriciated!
